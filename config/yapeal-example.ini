; Application agent string used as part of the HTTP User Agent header. (optional)
; Though optional use of this setting is highly recommended and should follow
; RFC 1945 or the extended format used by Mozilla which is documented at
; https://developer.mozilla.org/en/User_Agent_Strings_Reference
; Note that an agent string for Yapeal and libcurl will be appended
; automatically for all API requests.
; i.e. "{application_agent} Yapeal/{version} {stability} ({OS} {arch}) libcurl/{curl_version}"

; Sets mode for RegisteredCharacter/Corporation entries (optional)
; There are three modes possible: required, optional, ignored
;
; required - This mode is the most like the traditional mode of Yapeal where a
; row had to exist in utilRegisteredCharacter to have char APIs retrieved. The
; same was true for corp APIs and utilRegisteredCorporation.
;
; optional - This mode looks to see if there is a row like required does and
; uses any found but if there isn't a row it just uses the masks from
; utilSections and utilRegisteredKey tables along with one reported in
; APIKeyInfo API table.
;
; ignored - Only uses the masks from key in APIKeyInfo API table and the
; utilSections and utilRegisteredKey tables ignoring any entries in the other
; utilRegistered* tables.
;
; The above only talks about the mask from the tables but all the other settings
; in each table follow the same pattern, i.e. the proxy column would have no
; effect when the mode is set to ignore.
