Welcome to Yapeal (Yet Another PHP Eve Api Library)

If you're reading this on your server then you seem to have got Yapeal on it
and now you'll need to go to
http://MyHostName.com/Path/to/Yapeal/install/setup.php
with a web browser to finish the install.
In the future I hope to have sections on installing, configuring, setup, and
troubleshooting but for now best I can do is refer you to the project Wiki at
http://code.google.com/p/yapeal/
There you should find information to help you out. Another resource is the forum
thread for Yapeal at Eve Online which you'll find at
http://myeve.eve-online.com/ingameboard.asp?a=topic&threadID=904182

Thanks for using Yapeal, Dragonaire
