>1.1. What is Yapeal?</A
></H2
><P
>Yapeal is an acronym for Yet Another PHP EVE API Library. It was
      developed as part of a web base eve tool that has yet to be released but
      I thought the backend scripts that were used to pull information from
      the eve API should be extracted into thier own project and made
      available to others while the rest of the development continued.</P
><P
>Why call it Yet another? First off there's already been a couple
      other PHP API lib/classes made by other people and follow in the
      tradition of other open source projects I decide it was time to release
      what I'd been writing with a name along the lines of YaST (Yet another
      Setup Tool) or Wine (Wine Is Not an Emulator).</P

>1.2. What does it do?</A
></H2
><P
>A quick outline would be that it uses information from some tables
      in a MySQL database to make requests for XML files to the EVE-online API
      from CCP and then convert those files and puts them into tables in the
      same or another MySQL database for the users to use locally.</P

>1.3. How is it different from the others?</A
></H2
><P
>Not really sure since I haven't looked at them that close I can
      only tell you that Yapeal isn't setup as a class that you extend but is
      more procedural in nature while using some classes to do what it does.
      Also from what I've seen and read most the others seem to be made to be
      used by a single person or corporation in a single application where
      Yapeal is made to be used more as a command line script or as a Unix
      like crontab job to pull generic EVE information as will as stuff for
      multiple EVE corporations and individuals.</P
><P
>It can be used by a single corporation or charactor if you want
      but it was developed to be used in a multiple application framework
      where it needs to work for multiple users and applications without any
      extra programming work.</P

>1.4. What do I need to use it?</A
></H2
><P
>Nothing special in the software. You should be able to use it on a
      shared host with just a little configuration. It does require PHP5 and
      MySQL. It's been developed on a AMD 64 1GB linux system with PHP version
      5.2.6 and MySQL version 5.0.51a. It uses cURL for API connections and
      now I have replace MDB2 with ADOdb for the Database. If you'd like to
      use it like I do you'll also need shell access and be able to setup a
      crontab job. I believe it would also be used on a windows server if you
      know how to set up something like a Unix type crontab but I haven't
      tried it nor do I know for sure that it can be done. If someone tries it
      and would like to send me an explaination of how to do it I'll include
      it here in the future. Even better if they develop a BAT or CMD wrapper
      that can be used I'll be glad to include it with Yapeal.</P

>where you can find the latest version plus the latest version of
      this documention.</P
><P
>For now Yapeal is only being offered through the subversion at
      Google code. With future releases it maybe offered as tgz and/or zip
      files. See the project home above for instructions on how to get it from
      the subversion.</P

>2.2. Editing configuration file</A
></H2
><P
>Yapeal expect to find a file named <TT
CLASS="filename"
>yapeal.ini</TT
>
      in the config directory. There is an example configuration file in the
      config directory of Yapeal named <TT
CLASS="filename"
>yapeal.ini-example</TT
>
      that you'll want to copy and rename to <TT
CLASS="filename"
>yapeal.ini</TT
>
      then edit it for your local environment. The example have been largely
      commented to help users with any changes needed.</P
><P
>The default configuration for Yapeal is to use a separate database
      for each of the areas char, corp, eve, util but if you are limited on
      the number of databases you can have or want to use you can combine some
      or all of the different areas into a single database. Combining char and
      corp is the most likely area to cause problems because of overlapping
      table names.</P
><P
>Though Yapeal was made with the idea of having two
      username/password pairs per database to separate select only (reader)
      access and select, insert, update (writer) access that has been mostly
      unused and you only need one usename/password pair with full write
      access to each database and the same pair can and normally is used for
      all databases in a multiple database setup. For future versions all
      database access will only use the writer and all the reader settings
      will be removed but are being kept for now for backwards compatability
      with my other projects.</P

>Yapeal is being used to pull (request) data from some of the eve
      and corp APIs and that code is can be considered useable at this time
      while the code for char APIs is still in testing but largely based on
      the corp code which has been tested. Code for map and other areas
      available through the EVE API has not been written because my other
      projects haven't used them for anything yet but the code hopefully can
      be added soon if someone would help the author out adding them.</P

      later. Sample SQL to build some of the tables has been include but has
      not been fully checked or tested yet.</P

><P
>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
    functional and useful document "free" in the sense of freedom: to assure
    everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or
    without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily,
    this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit
    for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications
    made by others.</P
><P
>This License is a kind of "copyleft", which means that derivative
    works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense. It
    complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft license
    designed for free software.</P
><P
>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for
    free software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
    program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
    software does. But this License is not limited to software manuals; it can
    be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or whether it
    is published as a printed book. We recommend this License principally for
    works whose purpose is instruction or reference.</P

NAME="Definitions"
></A
>1. APPLICABILITY AND
    DEFINITIONS</H2
><P
>This License applies to any manual or other work, in any medium,
    that contains a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be
    distributed under the terms of this License. Such a notice grants a
    world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work
    under the conditions stated herein. The "Document", below, refers to any
    such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
    addressed as "you". You accept the license if you copy, modify or
    distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright
    law.</P
><P
>A "Modified Version" of the Document means any work containing the
    Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications
    and/or translated into another language.</P
><P
>A "Secondary Section" is a named appendix or a front-matter section
    of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
    publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
    (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
    within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook
    of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The
    relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject
    or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical
    or political position regarding them.</P
><P
>The "Invariant Sections" are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
    are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that
    says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does
    not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be
    designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections.
    If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are
    none.</P
><P
>The "Cover Texts" are certain short passages of text that are
    listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says
    that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may
    be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words.</P
><P
>A "Transparent" copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
    represented in a format whose specification is available to the general
    public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with
    generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint
    programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that
    is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a
    variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in
    an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup,
    has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by
    readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for
    any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not "Transparent" is called
    "Opaque".</P
><P
>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
    ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or
    XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML,
    PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent
    image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary
    formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors,
    SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally
    available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by
    some word processors for output purposes only.</P
><P
>The "Title Page" means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
    plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
    this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats
    which do not have any title page as such, "Title Page" means the text near
    the most prominent appearance of the work's title, preceding the beginning
    of the body of the text.</P
><P
>A section "Entitled XYZ" means a named subunit of the Document whose
    title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following
    text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a
    specific section name mentioned below, such as "Acknowledgements",
    "Dedications", "Endorsements", or "History".) To "Preserve the Title" of
    such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a
    section "Entitled XYZ" according to this definition.</P
><P
>The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice
    which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty
    Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License,
    but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that
    these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the
    meaning of this License.</P

    COPYING</H2
><P
>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
    commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright
    notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the
    Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
    conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical
    measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the
    copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in
    exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you
    must also follow the conditions in section 3.</P

    and you may publicly display copies.</P

>3. COPYING IN
    QUANTITY</H2
><P
>If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have
    printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the
    Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the
    copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts:
    Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back
    cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the
    publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title
    with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add
    other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to
    the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy
    these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other
    respects.</P
><P
>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
    legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably)
    on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages.</P
><P
>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
    more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy
    along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a
    computer-network location from which the general network-using public has
    access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete
    Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the
    latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
    distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent
    copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one
    year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or
    through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public.</P
><P
>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of
    the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to
    give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the
